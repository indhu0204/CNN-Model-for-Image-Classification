# Project Report: CNN Model for Image Classification

## 1. Introduction
This project aimed to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The model was trained on augmented data to improve performance and generalization, leveraging techniques like data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.

## 2. Objectives
- To build a CNN model that effectively classifies images.
- To utilize data augmentation to enhance model performance.
- To tune model hyperparameters to optimize validation accuracy.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Data Preparation
- **Image Resizing**: All images were resized to 64x64 pixels for uniformity.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling were applied to increase the dataset size and diversity.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values were scaled from [0, 255] to [0, 1] for better training convergence.
- **One-hot Encoding**: Labels were encoded to prepare for categorical classification.

### 3.2 Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: A simple CNN architecture was established with:
  - Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
  - Pooling layers for down-sampling.
  - Dense layers for classification.
- **Parameter Constraints**: The model was designed to have no more than 500,000 trainable parameters to mitigate overfitting.

### 3.3 Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Configurations**: Various configurations for the model architecture and learning rates were tested.
- **Training**: Models were trained using simple loops to avoid bias in validation data.
- **Performance Recording**: Training and validation accuracies were recorded for analysis.

### 3.4 Model Training
- The optimal model configuration was selected based on validation performance.
- Multiple training runs were conducted until a validation accuracy of over 80% was achieved.

## 4. Results
### 4.1 Model Performance
- **Validation Accuracy**: The optimal model consistently achieved a validation accuracy above 80%.
- **Testing Accuracy**: The final model was evaluated on a separate test dataset, yielding a testing accuracy of 91% .

### 4.2 Hyperparameter Summary
- **Optimal Layer Configuration**:[32, 64, 128]

- **Optimal Learning Rate**: [0.001]

### 4.3 Performance Dataframe
A dataframe summarizing model performance across various configurations was created for analysis. This included training accuracy, validation accuracy, and the number of parameters for each model.

## 5. Deployment
To deploy the model, a user interface was created using Gradio, allowing users to upload images for classification. The steps involved:
- Loading the trained model.
- Preprocessing the uploaded image.
- Making predictions based on the processed image.

## 6. Conclusion
The project successfully achieved its objectives of developing a robust CNN model for image classification using augmented data. The model was optimized through hyperparameter tuning and performed well on both validation and test datasets.

## 7. Future Work
- Explore more advanced architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet for improved performance.
- Implement real-time data augmentation techniques during training.
- Consider transfer learning approaches with pre-trained models to leverage existing knowledge.
